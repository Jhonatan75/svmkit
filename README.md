## Introduction

SVMKit is tailored for developers and operators who want to leverage the power of Solana's SVM (Solana Virtual Machine). This toolchain streamlines various operations, making it easier to manage validator nodes, deploy smart contracts, and interact with the blockchain.

### What is SVM?

The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. It is designed for high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for decentralized applications. SVMKit provides the necessary tools to interact with SVM effectively.

## Features

- **Validator Management**: Tools to help you set up and manage your validator nodes efficiently.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Easy deployment of smart contracts to the Solana blockchain.
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of transactions and events on the blockchain.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: A command-line interface that simplifies interactions with the blockchain.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: In-depth guides and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Usage

SVMKit comes with a variety of commands to facilitate your work. Below are some common commands you might find useful:

### Validator Commands

- **Start Validator**: Launch your validator node.

   ```bash
   svmkit validator start --config path/to/config.json
   ```

- **Stop Validator**: Safely stop your validator node.

   ```bash
   svmkit validator stop
   ```

### Smart Contract Commands

- **Deploy Contract**: Deploy a smart contract to the blockchain.

   ```bash
   svmkit contract deploy --path path/to/contract.wasm
   ```

- **Interact with Contract**: Call functions on your deployed smart contract.

   ```bash
   svmkit contract call --address <contract_address> --function <function_name> --args <arguments>
   ```

### Transaction Monitoring

- **Monitor Transactions**: Keep an eye on transactions in real-time.

   ```bash
   svmkit monitor transactions
   ```
